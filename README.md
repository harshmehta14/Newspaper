People tend to ignore the state of newspaper industry. Which is the sole reason why there existing no solution for it, And our inovation would be the very first approch towards a change in this sector.
In India reading newspaper is more of a tradition, and this solution would promise to hold the tradition for the future. And we have clear idea on what and how we need to execute the project.

The supply chain of the newspaper is inadequate,The biggest problem is the communication between the customer and supplier.
And that includes the payment gateway.
New customer/readers find it hard to contact a supplier.

We plan to make an interface that would facilitate the communication between the customer and the supplier.
1. Users of the interface can find local suppliers with ease.
2. Lists of different newspapers and their prices are available on the interface.
3. It includes a payment gateway for the customer to pay the supplier.
4. Users can pause newspaper delivery on specific days using the interface
